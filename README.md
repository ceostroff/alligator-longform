Week 1

This week, I built the basic outline of what my project will look like using a Bootstrap template.
Right now it's full of placeholder text and images, which will change after next week. The location of the images may also change and/or be replaced with other elements. I pretty much inserted them randomly just so that I could figure out the captions, get them centered, etc. I don't know what photos I'll be using yet, so I really didn't know where to put them. Nevertheless, they'll resemble the placeholder images as far as captions and placement.
I found it difficult to make the format appealing on mobile. The header image looks fine on a large screen or even an iPad, but on a phone I don't think anybody would be able to decipher what the image is. However, I think that just might be the nature of this particular image. Once I have the real images in place, I'll be able to tell.
I'm pretty pleased with how it looks in general. The header is basically the only part of the original template I used, while the sections that come after it  use the same code but with the header replaced with an article. It just looks pretty — more so than I thought it would, to be honest.
As far as libraries and tutorials, I used this (http://media2.wcpo.com/html/longform_template/builder) to figure out how to add photo captions. Originally I was doing the captions using a hover effect, but that obviously doesn't work for mobile. I think the way this site does it is better.
This part of the project was difficult because it was — I hope — the most time consuming. I had to find the template, remove everything I didn't want and then add styles for articles since it didn't originally come with them. I don't anticipate the time issue being a problem in the coming weeks, however.

Week 2

This week, I added the images and several js elements, as per my original proposal.

There's two important things to start with, though.
1. I deviated from my original proposal. I said I was going to use Leaflet to make a map of places this family moved to in/around the Orlando area, but that turned out to be totally irrelevant to the story. Therefore, I didn't make a map. If I would have, it wouldn't have helped the story at all. I would've been making it just because I could, which doesn't seem right to me.
2. I'm having a JavaScript problem that I couldn't solve by submission time. I'm sure you'll notice that both my chart and timeline, when they first appear, aren't sized correctly. They take up either too much or too little room. However, as soon as the page is resized at all, they take the form they're supposed to. I'm not sure why this is happening, but will figure it out by the time of the project's due date.
Those things aside, I thought the images turned out fine, if a little bottom-heavy. I had some trouble with placement, but I think they look fine. I might remove one from the last section.
I'm also not entirely done with the narrative, so placement might change. But once I get the sizing issue fixed, everything should be copy-and-paste-able.
I used this timeline template: https://timeline.knightlab.com/

Week 3

I'm basically gonna take the L this week. I changed the text size to make it more readable and appealing, as per your suggestion. I also made the pictures look less awkward by making them the same width as the text, also per your suggestion. But that's pretty much all I did.
In my original proposal, I said I was going to build an interactive element that tells readers about the danger zones of blood pressure as it relates to having a stroke, and I just didn't have the time to do it. It's completely my fault and I take full responsibility for it. If you want the background story, I was planning to do it from 4-6 today (Friday) when I got a call about an internship I applied for. I interviewed for over an hour and got offered the internship (yay!), but that left me with no time to do the assignment. I should have done it before Friday, but I did not.
I will, however, have that element done when I turn in the final piece of the project on Monday. Nevertheless, I fully accept whatever deductions result from my not turning in what I said I would turn in.
That aside, I do have a question for you before the final due date and before I launch this story. Your previous comments indicated that you'd like to see some sort of teaser that entices people to click to the next section. I think it's a really good idea (because you're right — I definitely assume people think the story is as interesting as I think it is), but I'm just not sure what exactly you mean.
When I read the comment, my first thought was to have a box pop up when a reader hovers over the arrow with either a pulled quote from the next section or a teaser like "Click to read about..." However, the obvious problem there is that hover is meaningless on a phone.
So I was wondering what you had in mind when you made that comment. Because again, I think it's a good idea. I'm just not sure how to place it.
Also, I apologize again for not having this week's part ready in time. I really, really despise being unprepared, but it got me this time. There's really nothing else I can say. I'm truly sorry.
