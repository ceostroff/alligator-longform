        </div>


            <p>
              <span class="firstcharacter">D</span><strong>oreen Forsythe was sitting at the park</strong> enjoying her 2-year-old son Jaxon’s play date when she saw a text message from her stepson, Hawke. He was at Orlando’s Mall at Millenia with his father, Ray, waiting for an eye exam when he decided to text Doreen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ray had been complaining about a bad headache all morning. Doreen noticed that the 42-year-old had taken longer than usual to get ready as a result. But she and Hawke didn’t think much of it. Ray had experienced headaches before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hawke also didn’t think much of his father’s mumbling. As they sped to the mall in Ray’s Porsche, he remembers his dad garbling about not feeling well.
            </p>
            <p>
              “He didn’t seem normal,” Hawke said. “He was kinda off.”
            </p>
            <p>
              But not off enough to say anything. That is, until his father left him at LensCrafters, medical paperwork unfinished, to slurp some pasta at the food court. Carbs always made him feel better.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where are you?” Hawke’s message read. “Daddy’s acting strange.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Doreen raced to the mall with her 2-year-old son, Jaxon, and teenage daughter, Gracie, in the family’s Chevy Suburban to check on her husband. They were supposed to meet at the mall anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yes, the then-high school freshman calls his father Daddy. All six of the Forsythe children — aged 1 to 25 — do. That includes Stone, Ray’s oldest son and a freshman offensive lineman for the Florida Gators football team. Back then, though, Stone didn’t have a scholarship offer from Florida. Not yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was at a camp in Gainesville that Saturday morning, Feb. 7, 2015, working on earning one. And he had plenty of motivation to do so.

            <p>
              From the time he understood what football was, Stone told his dad that he was going to play for the Gators. When Ray, Stone and Hawke took their annual fishing trip to Boca Grande on Florida’s gulf coast, they talked at length about those ambitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              And Ray, who played college football at Kent State and UCF before a one-year stint in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals, did everything he could to turn his son’s ambitions into his son’s future. He did the same for Hawke.
            </p>
            <p>
              “They still,” Doreen said, “I would say, secretly idolize their dad.”
            </p>
            <p>
            But what happens when Daddy doesn’t come home?
          </p>

      <div class="text">

        <p>
          <span class="firstcharacter">R</span><strong>ay struggled with as much strength as he could muster</strong> to fill out Hawke’s paperwork, but his hand had been hurting since he sat down. By the time he left for the food court, he couldn’t lift his entire right arm.

        </p>
        <p>
          “Hawke, I can’t write,” he told his son. “Can you fill this out for me? I don’t feel good so I’m gonna walk down to the food court.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Doreen found Hawke alone at LensCrafters when she arrived at the mall 20 minutes later. He needed help filling out the paperwork, so Doreen stayed with him and Jaxon.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Gracie,” she told her daughter, “go to the food court and make sure that he’s OK.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Gracie called a few minutes later to say that Ray was fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m gonna walk him to the car,” she added, “because he says he’s really tired and just doesn’t feel well.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That wasn’t new. Ray was on medication to control his blood pressure, which Doreen said made him feel sick sometimes. He also didn’t like shopping at the mall much, so sometimes he’d go wait in the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gracie returned a few minutes later and blazed over to the Apple store to get a cracked screen repaired. Doreen, meanwhile, waited with Hawke while he got his eyes checked.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Can you wait a second?” Doreen remembers asking the doctor as Hawke was about to get his eyes dilated.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled out her phone and sent a message to her husband. She thought it might be a good idea to check on him again.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Are you OK?” it read. “Do I need to be worried?”
        </p>
        <p>
          He called her back immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I think I’m having a stroke,” she remembers him telling her. “I can’t move my arm.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She sprinted out to the Suburban and found Ray lying down in the driver’s seat. His face was asymmetrical and his speech was slurred. Her heart rate rocketed.
        </p>
        <p>
          “As soon as I saw him and spoke to him,” she said, “I knew he was having a stroke.”
        </p>
        <div id="container"></div>
        <p>
          She dialed 911 and said the ambulance arrived about three minutes later. She vividly remembers her husband getting out of the car and walking to the waiting stretcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once Ray was strapped in, she rode with paramedics at full-siren to Florida Hospital after calling a family friend to pick up the kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the way, she called Ray’s mother and other family members to let them know what had happened. But after a couple of calls, she started to cry when she tried to put the event into words. She switched to texting. One person she didn’t call or text, though, was Stone, and it’s unclear when he found out what had happened. (<em>Editor’s note: It’s against team policy for Florida football freshmen to talk to the press</em>)
        </p>
        <p>
          The paramedics, meanwhile, called in a “code gray,” meaning a stroke patient was on the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It was intense,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they arrived at Florida Hospital, Ray’s right leg had gone limp. The same leg he’d used to walk to the stretcher about eight minutes earlier was now completely immobilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kids arrived soon after.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I was freaking out,” Hawke said. “I didn’t want anything to happen to him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ray was wheeled into room 21 of the Florida Hospital emergency room, where doctors started a multitude of tests. They discovered that Ray was suffering from a “hemorrhagic” stroke, meaning a bleed in his brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          One can imagine this kind of stroke like a hose, according Dr. Donald Stein, director of Emory University’s Brain Research Lab. He said he once bought a garden hose, hooked it up the faucet and turned the water on.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I didn’t release the pressure, and the whole thing blew up,” he said. “It just burst. That’s very similar.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The high water pressure is akin to high blood pressure, which Ray had problems with. However, he said he had it under control at the time of his stroke. By the time paramedics arrived, though, Doreen said she remembers his blood pressure measuring 220/180.
        </p>
        <p>
          And no matter the cause, this was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no immediate fix for this kind of stroke. There’s no way to stop the bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          All they could do was wait.
        </p>

          <span class="firstcharacter">B</span><strong>ob Head opened his inbox</strong> to find a barrage of emails from Ray Forsythe.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What in the world?” the head coach at Orlando’s West Orange High School — the alma mater of Stone, Hawke and their father — thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each email contained a video of Stone doing some sort of exercise with Ray in the early morning hours one weekend during his sophomore year.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Coach," Head remembers Ray saying, “we’re reaching milestones today.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He then turned the camera on Stone — who currently measures 6-foot-7, 329 pounds — doing interval training on the treadmill before announcing that Stone had hit a new high of 315 pounds on the bench press.
        </p>

        <p>
          Head approached Stone in class the following Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Man,” he remembers telling him, “your dad is working your ass off isn’t he?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Stone answered honestly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yeah,” Head remembers him saying. “He’s killing me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The coach shot back.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Keep it going, man,” he told him. “It’s gonna pay off for you in the long run.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several years later, Stone would accomplish his life-long goal of playing football at Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that started with his fitness-crazed father Ray, who made sure his boys did everything they possibly could to be elite football players.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he wasn’t standing around with a clipboard jotting down his sons’ progress. He was sweating alongside them.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Before he had his stroke,” Head said, “I could see him putting pads on and still getting out and playing.
        </p>
        <p>
          “When he put his hands on you, it’s like a catcher’s mitt. Just huge.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in his high school days, Ray was a standout athlete at the same school his boys eventually played at. To this day, he holds the West Orange shot-put, discus and bench press records.
        </p>
        <p>
          He won the state weightlifting title in 1990 by bench pressing 445 pounds and as a result, his picture still hangs in the West Orange weight room today.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also hangs in separate areas of the weight room to commemorate athletes who left the school and played in college as well as athletes who went pro.
        </p>

        <p>
          But he wanted more for his sons. And with Stone, he got what he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He is a monster,” Head said of Stone. “And when he gets mad and displays it, ugh. He can be unstoppable.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Head remembers one game in particular when Stone picked up the opposing team’s defender and slammed him to the turf. He was flagged for holding.
        </p>
        <p>
          “How can you call holding when he literally picked him up and demolished him?” Head remembers pleading with the referee.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t know,” He remembers the referee telling him, “but he really abused that guy, so I called something. Something needed to be called there.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Even on seemingly excellent plays like that one, though, Ray was rarely satisfied with Stone’s performance. He believed the only way Stone — as well as Hawke — would be the best was if he was honest and critical all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They’re real close to their dad,” Head said. “(He) really drove them and pushed them — especially Stone — really pushed him to become a really good player.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But when Ray suffered his stroke during the spring semester of Stone’s junior year, Head noticed an immediate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It hit him really hard when his dad was going through that,” he said. “He didn’t say a whole lot, but I could see it.”
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          “I think he was still in shock,” Head said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked all the typical questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          “How’s Ray?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing.

          “How’s he doing?”

        <p>
          “How’s he feeling?”

        <p>
          Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Stone would never tell me,” he said. “You’re gonna have to pull it out of him.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Doreen also tried to get Stone to talk, but she said he and his brother tend to internalize their emotions. That remains true to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He’s a spoken-to-first type of guy,” UF teammate Fred Johnson said. “You have to speak to him first. He doesn’t really talk to you and stuff like that. He’s a really cool, gentle being.”

        <p>
          While he may not have vocalized it, Stone’s actions showed how much he cared.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a one-week stay at Florida Hospital, Ray was transferred to a rehabilitation center in Jacksonville called Brooks Rehabilitation. It was about three hours away from home, but Stone and the rest of the family went up with him on Valentine’s Day and continued to go up every weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, except for Doreen and Jaxon. Doreen didn’t want to leave her husband alone, so she made arrangements to sleep on a pullout couch in Ray’s room along with 2-year-old Jaxon.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was also pregnant at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stroke had occurred in Ray’s left brain stem, which is why the right side of his body was affected. As for recovery, nothing was certain. Recovery from brain injuries varies by severity, and severity is hard to gauge.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If somebody gets a strangle hold on you,” Dr. Stein said, “it might knock you out. You lose consciousness. But if they let up, you could still survive.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, strangulation is a metaphor for damaged brain cells. Even though Ray’s brain was impaired from the stroke at first, the effects could only be temporary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it would take hours of therapy every day to regain his mobility, dexterity and proper speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He said it was probably the hardest thing he’d ever done,” Hawke said. “It made him… mad, because he couldn’t do what he wanted to do.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And the one thing he wanted more than anything was to be on the sideline for Friday Night Lights at West Orange watching his sons play football. He had about six months until game day.

          For the first time in a week, he was on his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I was a nervous wreck following behind thinking he’s gonna fall and oh my gosh, they’re gonna break his neck,” she said, “but they did it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, the staff at Brooks asked him what his short-term recovery goals were.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said he wanted to walk the sideline at his sons’ football games, as if that was even a question.

          It took five hours of therapy a day, but after two months at Brooks, he was able to walk out the front door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, his sixth child, Harrison Brooks Forsythe, was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          And soon after that, he was in Jacksonville on the campus of Trinity Christian Academy to watch Stone start at left tackle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hawke was there, too, but as a sophomore, he didn’t play at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, until the third quarter, when coach Head lined him up at left guard, right next to his brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I thought I would never see that happen,” Ray said.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Life was completed. All the hard work had paid off.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There was still one more goal he had in mind, though: Getting his kids on the field at UF and being there to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That’s the ultimate goal,” he said.

          As he did, the familiar “chomp” video blared on the jumbotron. It was time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Heeeeere come the Gators!” the announcer screamed through the stadium’s speakers, simultaneously sending the crowd into a raucous frenzy and moving Ray to tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          There he was — the son he’d spent all those hours preparing, teaching and loving — running out into The Swamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          “God, it was just an unexplainable feeling,” he said. “All I could do was cry for him.”

          As he recalls it, Doreen turned to him at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You’re not crying, are you?” she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yeah,” he answered from his handicapped seating. “I’m crying.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment wasn’t all glamorous, though. During the game, Ray’s physical limitations were inescapable.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Did I envision it that way?” He said of attending Stone’s first game as a Gator. “No. Because I didn’t participate after having a stroke and being in a wheelchair. So I was kind of sad because I had to see his first game like that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, those feelings faded when the end of the game got closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the final seconds had ticked away, he made his way to the south end of the stadium by the Bull Gator Statue to greet his son. Doreen remembers the day being physically taxing on her husband. Unable to walk the long distances to the stadium, he sat waiting for Stone in his wheelchair.
        </p>
        <p>
          When No. 72 arrived, Ray got up and embraced his son.

          “I’m sure he said some silly comment to him,” Doreen said.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as Ray recalls it, he didn’t say much. Just a simple congratulations. Both he and Stone understood the significance without anything flashy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There’s not a high percentage of kids at two years old or three years old that say I want to play for Florida and it actually happens,” Ray said.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It was a very emotional feeling for me.”
